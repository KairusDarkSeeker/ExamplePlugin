# ExamplePlugin
Plugin skeleton for PocketMine-MP related server softwares

# How do I use this?
- Simply download [FolderPluginLoader & DevTools](https://github.com/iTXTech/DevTools/releases) then drop it on the plugins folder.
- After that, download [this repository](https://github.com/KairusDarkSeeker/ExamplePlugin/archive/master.zip)
- Then, what you're gonna do is extract the ExamplePlugin-master.zip to the server's plugin directory then start the server.
- If you want to compile this plugin into a phar file, use /mp ExamplePlugin and it'll make a file called ` ExamplePlugin_v1.0.0.phar ` on the directory ` plugins/Genisys-DevTools_OUTPUT ` then you'll see the phar file there.

##### Have fun at coding!!!
